title: About Me
---

<p align=”justify”>
    An air force brat, born in Rajasthan & brought up in several cities of India, developed a peculiar interest in computers when I heard about them when I was 5 years old.

I am a software engineer by profession currently working on world class email security appliance at Cisco Systems. I have strong foundations in backend development and recently developed interest in working on UI. I am a perfectionist and love structure and order and stand for quality. I love to solve problems, hence you will always find me discussing solutions to software problems by using better data structures, design patterns or architecture.
</p>
<p align=”justify”>
Apart from computers, I have a fascination for human psychology. I always wonder how human thought process and behaviour works. </p>
<p align=”justify”>
When I get free time from these two interesting topics, I am usually found playing computer games, reading books(often), reading tech blogs, watching youtube videos, playing badminton, football and TT.

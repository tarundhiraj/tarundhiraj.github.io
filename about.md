title: About Me

<p align=”justify”>
    An air force brat, born in Rajasthan & brought up in several cities of India, developed a peculiar interest in computers when I heard about them when I was 5 years old. I saw a computer first time when I was visiting a doctor for consulation.

Few years later, my first "real" encounter with computers happend when I was in 5th class and had computers as one of the periods. I still remember the first thing I did on the school computer was to ask Microsoft Office Assistant what the capital of United States was, as I thought computers know everything and anything. Step ahead few more years during my high school days when I started learning my first computer language "C". It felt like a black magic to me. Having the power to program the computer the way I want to and the computer would do whatever you have programmed it to do.

At that time, I used to get irritated by the statements made by people about the zero IQ of the comuters and having no brain of itself to do any task. I used to wonder if we could be able to program computers to learn things just like a humann child does, then it would be able to learn it very fast annd do things independently. Nowadays we call this phenomenon as Artificial Intelligence (where are you guys who called computers a dumb machine huh!!!). After getting to learn my first language, there was no stopping and I went on to pursue bachelors and then masters in computers. I still want to pursue PhD but that seems a distant dream.

Apart from computers, I have a fascination for human psychology. I always wonder how human thought process and behaviour works. </p>

When I get free time from these two interesting topics, I am usually found playing computer games, reading books(often), reading tech blogs, watching youtube videos, playing badminton, football and TT.
